# Ask4 assignment using Laravel framework

### Implementation

I have implemented database schema by using Laravel migration, such as

- Go to this location \database\migration\ and check all migrations that have been created to create database according to assignment requirement.
- Go to this location \app\Models\ and you can see here all the models[tables] by using that we can query information with different defined relationships between entities.
- Go to this location \app\Ask4\ and you can see here our classes structure to manage devices via telnet or SSH.
- Go to this location \app\Console\Commands\NetworkCommand.php and you can see here command execution script.
